# ECE250: Signals & Systems

## About ECE250

[<b>ECE250: *Signals & Systems*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=ECE250)</b> is a 2xx-level course offered to undergrads pursuing the CSAI and ECE disciplines at IIIT-Delhi. The course centers around exposing students to the concepts of discrete-time and continuous-time signals, transforms, and their applications. It aims to enable students to:

- classify basic signal representations
- determine the response of an LTI-system to input signals.
- represent signals as [Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series)
- analyze signals using [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) and [Laplace transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform)
